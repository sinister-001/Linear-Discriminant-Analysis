# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis

Hi guys! After a long gap I have created a new repository on Dimensionality Reduction Techniques. One of them is **Linear Discriminant Analysis**. Here I have implemeneted the LDA and also model training without using inbuilt functions. The model I have used for training is **KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) CLassifier**.

Here I have implemented the same model on two different datasets. CS21B2036_Q1 is for *gender.csv* file and CS21B2036_Q2 is for *face.csv* file

Go through the repository and check the complete code.

Happy Learning :)
